To implement and run the code for this rule engine with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), you can follow these steps. I'll break down the development process and suggest where and how to run the code.

1. Environment Setup
For this project, you'll need to set up a development environment where you can write and execute Python code (since Python is well-suited for handling AST and APIs). You can run the application on your local machine, in an IDE, or on the cloud. Here's what you'll need:

Required Tools:
Python 3.x: Install Python from python.org.
Flask  
Install Flask: pip install Flask
 Database: Use SQLite for simplicity, or opt for PostgreSQL or MySQL for more complex data handling.
SQLite is built-in with Python.
 For MySQL: pip install mysql-connector-python
IDEs or Editors:
VS Code: A popular choice for coding, supports Python with extensions.


 2. Project Structure
You can organize your code in a directory structure as follows:
rule-engine-ast/
│
├── app.py          # Main application file (API layer)
├── ast_engine.py   # Rule engine logic (AST handling)
├── database.py     # Database models and interactions
├── models.py       # Data classes or schemas (for request/response)
└── requirements.txt # Dependencies (Flask/FastAPI, databases)


3. Data Structure (AST Representation)
You can define a Node class to represent the AST. Here’s a simple Python class:

4. API Design (with Flask or FastAPI)
app.py - API Layer
You can design RESTful APIs using Flask or FastAPI. Here’s an example of how to set up an API with Flask:


REFER TO ruleengine_app.py file

5. Rule Creation and Evaluation
Here’s an example of the core rule creation and evaluation functions.

REFER TO ruleengine_ast.py file

6. Database Storage
You can store the AST rules in a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL. Here's an example of using SQLite.

for schema representation REFER TO  REFER TO ruleengine_schema_database_sqllite.db file

for database - REFER TO ruleengine_database.py file

7. Test Cases
Test the system by creating unit tests for the main functionalities


refer to ruleengine_test.py file

8. Running the Application
